# My thoughts on AI and the future!

You may think that Allen Iverson, otherwise known as AI, has his best days behind him.

I'm here to disprove you.


## My Journey

I started my career in data science after completing my Master's degree in Data Science from Northwestern University. During my time there, I developed a strong foundation in AI and machine learning, which I have been able to apply in various projects and roles.

## Why AI and Machine Learning?

AI and machine learning have always fascinated me because of their potential to transform industries and improve lives. From automating mundane tasks to providing insights that drive business decisions, the possibilities are endless.

## Looking Ahead

I look forward to sharing more insights and experiences with you in future posts. Stay tuned for more updates!

Thank you for reading!
