# Hi - I'm Rohit!

I currently work on AI/ML at Toyota Connected and am in graduate school at Northwestern University. My focus is on building reliable, efficient, and scalable AI solutions.

Over the past year, I've contributed to projects improving customer experience, safety, and mobility through AI. I'm excited to apply AI to broader consumer challenges.

I also love music production. I switch off between playing the guitar, experimenting with mixing audio, and working with artists.
